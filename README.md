## Cam's Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for a personal website. The website is built using HTML and CSS, and it showcases the owner's work, skills, and contact information.

## Structure

The website is structured into several sections:

Navbar: Contains navigation links to different sections of the website.
Intro: Introduces the person (Cam) and what he does.
Projects: Showcases Cam's projects.
Contact: Provides contact information.
Footer: Contains additional links and copyright information.

## Styling

The website's styling is defined in the style.css file. It uses CSS variables for colors and fonts, which are declared at the root level. The website uses a responsive design, with different styles applied based on the width of the viewport.

## Animations

The website uses CSS animations for certain elements. For example, the rotateHue animation is applied to the first child of the navigation list, causing it to continuously change color.

## Divider
